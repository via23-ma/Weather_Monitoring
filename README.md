# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

## Description
This system fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at regular intervals for metro cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, etc.). It processes the data to calculate daily weather summaries, such as average temperature, maximum/minimum temperature, and the dominant weather condition. The system also features an alerting mechanism for user-defined thresholds.

## Features
- Continuous weather data retrieval every 5 minutes for metro cities.
- Conversion of temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.
- Daily weather summaries including average, max, and min temperatures.
- Alerts for user-defined temperature thresholds (e.g., above 35Â°C).

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **SQLite3**: Database for storing weather data.
- **Requests**: For API calls to OpenWeatherMap.
